# pytorch-dp: Train PyTorch models with Differential Privacy

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/facebookresearch/pytorch-dp.svg?style=svg&circle-token=247aedbb579492ef94652ea93bbee4e169457795)](https://circleci.com/gh/facebookresearch/pytorch-dp)

pytorch-dp is a library that enables training PyTorch models with differential privacy. It supports training with minimal code changes required on the client, has little impact on training performance and allows the client to online track the privacy budget expended at any given moment.

*PyTorch Privacy is currently a preview beta and under active development!*

### Target audience
This code release is aimed at two target audiences:
1. ML practicioners will find this code a gentle introduction to training a model with differential privacy as it requires minimal code changes.
2. Differential Privacy scientists will find this code easy to experiment and tinker with, allowing them to focus on what matters.


## Installation
Currently, we only supporting installing from source. To do that, just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch-dp.git
cd pytorch-dp
pip install -e
```

## Getting started
To train your model with differential privacy, all you need to do is to declare a PrivacyEngine and attach it to your optimizer before running, eg:

```python
model = Net()
optimizer = SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.05)
privacy_engine = PrivacyEngine(
    model,
    train_loader,
    alphas=[1, 10, 100],
    noise_multiplier=1.3,
    max_grad_norm=1.0,
)
privacy_engine.attach(optimizer)
# Now it's business as usual
```
The [MNIST example](examples/mnist.py) contains an end to end run.
